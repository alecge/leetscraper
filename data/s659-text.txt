Approach #1: DFS [Accepted]
Intuition and Algorithm
For each edge (u, v), traverse the graph with a depth-first search to see if we can connect u to v. If we can, then it must be the duplicate edge.
Python
class Solution(object):
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
        graph = collections.defaultdict(set)

        def dfs(source, target):
            if source not in seen:
                seen.add(source)
                if source == target: return True
                return any(dfs(nei, target) for nei in graph[source])

        for u, v in edges:
            seen = set()
            if u in graph and v in graph and dfs(u, v):
                return u, v
            graph[u].add(v)
            graph[v].add(u)

        }

            if (!graph[edge[0]].isEmpty() && !graph[edge[1]].isEmpty() &&
                    dfs(graph, edge[0], edge[1])) {

            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }

Approach #2: Union-Find [Accepted]
Intuition and Algorithm
If we are familiar with a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, we can use this in a straightforward manner to solve the problem: we simply find the first edge occurring in the graph that is already connected. The rest of this explanation will focus on the details of implementing DSU.
A DSU data structure can be used to maintain knowledge of the connected components of a graph, and query for them quickly. In particular, we would like to support two operations:
dsu.find(node x), which outputs a unique id so that two nodes have the same id if and only if they are in the same connected component, and:
dsu.union(node x, node y), which draws an edge (x, y) in the graph, connecting the components with id find(x) and find(y) together.
To achieve this, we keep track of parent, which remembers the id of a smaller node in the same connected component. If the node is it's own parent, we call this the leader of that connected component.
A naive implementation of a DSU structure would look something like this:
Psuedocode
# parent initialized as (x -> x)
function find(x):
    while parent[x] != x: #While x isn't the leader
        x = parent[x]
    return x

function union(x, y):
    parent[find(x)] = find(y)
We use two techniques to improve the run-time complexity: path compression, and union-by-rank.
Path compression involves changing the x = parent[x] in the find function to parent[x] = find(parent[x]). Basically, as we compute the correct leader for x, we should remember our calculation.
Union-by-rank involves distributing the workload of find across leaders evenly. Whenever we dsu.union(x, y), we have two leaders xr, yr and we have to choose whether we want parent[x] = yr or parent[y] = xr. We choose the leader that has a lower following to pick up a new follower.
Specifically, the meaning of rank is that there are less than 2 ^ rank[x] followers of x. This strategy can be shown to give us better bounds for how long the recursive loop in dsu.find could run for.
class DSU(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.par = range(2001)
        self.rnk = [0] * 2001

    def find(self, x):
        if self.par[x] != x:
            self.par[x] = self.find(self.par[x])
        return self.par[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        xr, yr = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if xr == yr:
            return False
        elif self.rnk[xr] < self.rnk[yr]:
            self.par[xr] = yr
        elif self.rnk[xr] > self.rnk[yr]:
            self.par[yr] = xr
        else:
            self.par[yr] = xr
            self.rnk[xr] += 1
        return True

class Solution(object):
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
        dsu = DSU()
        for edge in edges:
            if not dsu.union(*edge):
                return edge
Alternate Implementation of DSU without Union-By-Rank
class DSU:
    def __init__(self):
        self.par = range(2001)
    def find(self, x):
        if self.par[x] != x:
            self.par[x] = self.find(self.par[x])
        return self.par[x]
    def union(self, x, y):
        self.par[self.find(x)] = self.find(y)
Java
class Solution {
    int MAX_EDGE_VAL = 2000;

    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        DSU dsu = new DSU(MAX_EDGE_VAL + 1);
        for (int[] edge: edges) {
            if (!dsu.union(edge[0], edge[1])) return edge;
        }
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}

class DSU {
    int[] parent;
    int[] rank;

    public DSU(int size) {
        parent = new int[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) parent[i] = i;
        rank = new int[size];
    }

    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    public boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int xr = find(x), yr = find(y);
        if (xr == yr) {
            return false;
        } else if (rank[xr] < rank[yr]) {
            parent[xr] = yr;
        } else if (rank[xr] > rank[yr]) {
            parent[yr] = xr;
        } else {
            parent[yr] = xr;
            rank[xr]++;
