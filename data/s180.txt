Algorithm</strong></p>
Consecutive appearing means the Id of the Num are next to each others. Since this problem asks for numbers appearing at least three times consecutively, we can use 3 aliases for this table Logs</strong>, and then check whether 3 consecutive numbers are all the same.</p>
</span>SELECT</span> *</span>
FROM</span>
    Logs</span> l1</span>,</span>
    Logs</span> l2</span>,</span>
    Logs</span> l3</span>
WHERE</span>
    l1</span>.</span>Id</span> =</span> l2</span>.</span>Id</span> -</span> 1</span>
    AND</span> l2</span>.</span>Id</span> =</span> l3</span>.</span>Id</span> -</span> 1</span>
    AND</span> l1</span>.</span>Num</span> =</span> l2</span>.</span>Num</span>
    AND</span> l2</span>.</span>Num</span> =</span> l3</span>.</span>Num</span>

Then we can select any Num</em> column from the above table to get the target data. However, we need to add a keyword DISTINCT</code> because it will display a duplicated number if one number appears more than 3 times consecutively.</p>
