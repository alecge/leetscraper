<h4 id="approach-using-join-and-in-clause-accepted">Approach: Using JOIN</code> and IN</code> clause [Accepted]</h4>
Algorithm</strong></p>
Since the Employee</strong> table contains the Salary</em> and DepartmentId</em> information, we can query the highest salary in a department.</p>
</span>SELECT</span>
    DepartmentId</span>,</span> MAX</span>(</span>Salary</span>)</span>
FROM</span>
    Employee</span>
GROUP</span> BY</span> DepartmentId</span>;</span>
</pre></div>



Note: There might be multiple employees having the same highest salary, so it is safe not to include the employee name information in this query.</p>
</blockquote>
</span>| DepartmentId | MAX(Salary) |
|--------------|-------------|
| 1            | 90000       |
| 2            | 80000       |
</pre></div>


Then, we can join table Employee</strong> and Department</strong>, and query the (DepartmentId, Salary) are in the temp table using IN</code> statement as below.</p>
MySQL</strong></p>
</span>SELECT</span>
    Department</span>.</span>name</span> AS</span> 'Department'</span>,</span>
    Employee</span>.</span>name</span> AS</span> 'Employee'</span>,</span>
    Salary</span>
FROM</span>
    Employee</span>
        JOIN</span>
    Department</span> ON</span> Employee</span>.</span>DepartmentId</span> =</span> Department</span>.</span>Id</span>
WHERE</span>
    (</span>Employee</span>.</span>DepartmentId</span> ,</span> Salary</span>)</span> IN</span>
    (</span>   SELECT</span>
            DepartmentId</span>,</span> MAX</span>(</span>Salary</span>)</span>
        FROM</span>
            Employee</span>
        GROUP</span> BY</span> DepartmentId</span>
    )</span>
;</span>
</pre></div>


</span>| Department | Employee | Salary |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
