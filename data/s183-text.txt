Solution
Approach: Using sub-query and NOT IN clause [Accepted]
Algorithm
If we have a list of customers who have ever ordered, it will be easy to know who never ordered.
We can use the following code to get such list.
select customerid from orders;
Then, we can use NOT IN to query the customers who are not in this list.
MySQL
select customers.name as 'Customers'
from customers
where customers.id not in
(
    select customerid from orders
);
