Solution
Approach #1 Brute Force [Time Limit Exceeded]
Algorithm
For the brute force solution, firstly we obtain the directory paths, the filenames and file contents separately by appropriately splitting the elements of the
paths
paths list. While doing so, we keep on creating a
list
list which contains the full path of every file along with the contents of the file. The
list
list contains data in the form
[ [file_1\_full\_path, file_1\_contents], [file_2\_full\_path, file_2\_contents]..., [file_n\_full\_path, file_n\_contents] ]
[[file
1
_full_path,file
1
_contents],[file
2
_full_path,file
2
_contents]...,[file
n
_full_path,file
n
_contents]].
Once this is done, we iterate over this
list
list. For every element
i
i chosen from the list, we iterate over the whole
list
list to find another element
j
j whose file contents are the same as the
i^{th}
i
th
element. For every such element found, we put the
j^{th}
j
th
element's file path in a temporary list
l
l and we also mark the
j^{th}
j
th
element as visited so that this element isn't considered again in the future. Thus, when we reach the end of the array for every
i^{th}
i
th
element, we obtain a list of file paths in
l
l, which have the same contents as the file corresponding to the
i^{th}
i
th
element. If this list isn't empty, it indicates that there exists content duplicate to the
i^{th}
i
th
element. Thus, we also need to put the
i^{th}
i
th
element's file path in the
l
l.
At the end of each iteration, we put this list
l
l obtained in the resultant list
res
res and reset the list
l
l for finding the duplicates of the next element.
Java
public class Solution {
    public List < List < String >> findDuplicate(String[] paths) {
        List < String[] > list = new ArrayList < > ();
        for (String path: paths) {
            String[] values = path.split(" ");
            for (int i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {
                String[] name_cont = values[i].split("\\(");
                name_cont[1] = name_cont[1].replace(")", "");
                list.add(new String[] {
                    values[0] + "/" + name_cont[0], name_cont[1]
                });
            }
        }
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[list.size()];
        List < List < String >> res = new ArrayList < > ();
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (visited[i])
                continue;
            List < String > l = new ArrayList < > ();
            for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
                if (list.get(i)[1].equals(list.get(j)[1])) {
                    l.add(list.get(j)[0]);
                    visited[j] = true;
                }
            }
            if (l.size() > 0) {
                l.add(list.get(i)[0]);
                res.add(l);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Approach #2 Using HashMap [Accepted]
In this approach, firstly we obtain the directory paths, the file names and their contents separately by appropriately splitting each string in the given
paths
paths list. In order to find the files with duplicate contents, we make use of a HashMap
map
map, which stores the data in the form
(contents, list\_of\_file\_paths\_with\_this\_content)
(contents,list_of_file_paths_with_this_content). Thus, for every file's contents, we check if the same content already exist in the hashmap. If so, we add the current file's path to the list of files corresponding to the current contents. Otherwise, we create a new entry in the
map
map, with the current contents as the key and the value being a list with only one entry(the current file's path).
At the end, we find out the contents corresponding to which atleast two file paths exist. We obtain the resultant list
res
res, which is a list of lists containing these file paths corresponding to the same contents.
The following animation illustrates the process for a clearer understanding.
