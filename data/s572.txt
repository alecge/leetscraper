<h4 id="approach-i-using-where-clause-and-or-accepted">Approach I: Using WHERE</code> clause and OR</code> [Accepted]</h4>
Intuition</strong></p>
Use WHERE</code> clause in SQL to filter these records and get the target countries.</p>
Algorithm</strong></p>
According to the definition, a big country meets at least one of the following two conditions:
1. It has an area of bigger than 3 million square km.
2. It has a population of more than 25 million.</p>
So for the first condition, we can use the following code to get the big countries of this type.</p>
</span>SELECT</span> name</span>,</span> population</span>,</span> area</span> FROM</span> world</span> WHERE</span> area</span> &gt;</span> 3000000</span>
</pre></div>


In addition, we can use below code to get big countries of more than 25 million people.</p>
</span>SELECT</span> name</span>,</span> population</span>,</span> area</span> FROM</span> world</span> WHERE</span> population</span> &gt;</span> 25000000</span>
</pre></div>


As most people may already come into mind, we can use OR</code> to combine these two solutions for the two sub-problems together.</p>
MySQL</strong></p>
</span>SELECT</span>
    name</span>,</span> population</span>,</span> area</span>
FROM</span>
    world</span>
WHERE</span>
    area</span> &gt;</span> 3000000</span> OR</span> population</span> &gt;</span> 25000000</span>
;</span>
</pre></div>


<h4 id="approach-ii-using-where-clause-and-union-accepted">Approach II: Using WHERE</code> clause and UNION</code> [Accepted]</h4>
Algorithm</strong></p>
The idea of this approach is the same as the first one. However, we use UNION</code> instead of OR</code>.</p>
MySQL</strong></p>
</span>SELECT</span>
    name</span>,</span> population</span>,</span> area</span>
FROM</span>
    world</span>
WHERE</span>
    area</span> &gt;</span> 3000000</span>

UNION</span>

SELECT</span>
    name</span>,</span> population</span>,</span> area</span>
FROM</span>
    world</span>
WHERE</span>
    population</span> &gt;</span> 25000000</span>
;</span>
</pre></div>



Note: This solution runs a little bit faster than the first one. However, they do not have big difference.</p>
