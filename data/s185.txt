Algorithm</strong></p>
A top 3 salary in this company means there is no more than 3 salary bigger than itself in the company.</p>
</span>select</span> e1</span>.</span>Name</span> as</span> 'Employee'</span>,</span> e1</span>.</span>Salary</span>
from</span> Employee</span> e1</span>
where</span> 3</span> &gt;</span>
(</span>
    select</span> count</span>(</span>distinct</span> e2</span>.</span>Salary</span>)</span>
    from</span> Employee</span> e2</span>
    where</span> e2</span>.</span>Salary</span> &gt;</span> e1</span>.</span>Salary</span>
)</span>
;</span>
</pre></div>


In this code, we count the salary number of which is bigger than e1.Salary. So the output is as below for the sample data.</p>
</span>| Employee | Salary |
|----------|--------|
| Henry    | 80000  |
| Max      | 90000  |
| Randy    | 85000  |
</pre></div>


Then, we need to join the Employee</strong> table with Department</strong> in order to retrieve the department information.</p>

</span>SELECT</span>
    d</span>.</span>Name</span> AS</span> 'Department'</span>,</span> e1</span>.</span>Name</span> AS</span> 'Employee'</span>,</span> e1</span>.</span>Salary</span>
FROM</span>
    Employee</span> e1</span>
        JOIN</span>
    Department</span> d</span> ON</span> e1</span>.</span>DepartmentId</span> =</span> d</span>.</span>Id</span>
WHERE</span>
    3</span> &gt;</span> (</span>SELECT</span>
            COUNT</span>(</span>DISTINCT</span> e2</span>.</span>Salary</span>)</span>
        FROM</span>
            Employee</span> e2</span>
        WHERE</span>
            e2</span>.</span>Salary</span> &gt;</span> e1</span>.</span>Salary</span>
                AND</span> e1</span>.</span>DepartmentId</span> =</span> e2</span>.</span>DepartmentId</span>
        )</span>
;</span>
