Solution
Approach: Using outer join [Accepted]
Algorithm
Since the PersonId in table Address is the foreign key of table Person, we can join this two table to get the address information of a person.
Considering there might not be an address information for every person, we should use outer join instead of the default inner join.
MySQL
select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
;
Note: Using where clause to filter the records will fail if there is no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
