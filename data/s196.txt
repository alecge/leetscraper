Solution</h2>

<h4 id="approach-using-delete-and-where-clause-accepted">Approach: Using DELETE</code> and WHERE</code> clause [Accepted]</h4>
Algorithm</strong></p>
By joining this table with itself on the Email</em> column, we can get the following code.</p>
</span>SELECT</span> p1</span>.</span>*</span>
FROM</span> Person</span> p1</span>,</span>
    Person</span> p2</span>
WHERE</span>
    p1</span>.</span>Email</span> =</span> p2</span>.</span>Email</span>
;</span>
</pre></div>


Then we need to find the bigger id having same email address with other records. So we can add a new condition to the WHERE</code> clause like this.</p>
</span>SELECT</span> p1</span>.</span>*</span>
FROM</span> Person</span> p1</span>,</span>
    Person</span> p2</span>
WHERE</span>
    p1</span>.</span>Email</span> =</span> p2</span>.</span>Email</span> AND</span> p1</span>.</span>Id</span> &gt;</span> p2</span>.</span>Id</span>
;</span>
</pre></div>


As we already get the records to be deleted, we can alter this statement to DELETE</code> in the end.</p>
