Solution
Approach: Using JOIN and DATEDIFF() clause [Accepted]
Algorithm
MySQL uses DATEDIFF to compare two date type values.
So, we can get the result by joining this table weather with itself and use this DATEDIFF() function.
MySQL
SELECT
    weather.id AS 'Id'
FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.date, w.date) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
;
