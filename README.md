# Leet(code)Scraper

This script non-premium problems and solutions off of Leetcode.  It is working as of October 3rd, 2017.

By default, the script assumes there is a Docker chrome-standalone-debug instance running on http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.  
To use something different, edit the driver variable.  An example of using firefox as a driver on Windows is included.

Problems are default saved under data/ in the parent directory.
